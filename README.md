<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was developed as the final assignment for the GEOL0069 (AI for Earth Observation) module at University College London. The module equips students with the skills to apply machine learning (ML) techniques to the growing volume of data generated by Earth observation satellites.

In this project, we apply supervised learning to extract a range of shallow reef features from satellite imagery. We focus on data from Sentinel-2, chosen for its high-resolution multispectral capabilities; an essential requirement for our algorithm of choice, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The aim is to demonstrate how modern ML tools can support ecological monitoring by providing a minimal-footprint workflow that anyone can run on free Sentinel-2 imagery to generate habitat predictions from scratch with only a handful of hand-labelled pixels.

### Background

Shallow reef zones are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth, supporting nearly 25% of all marine species. These structures play vital roles in coastal protection, fisheries, and global biodiversity. However, they are increasingly under threat from climate change, coral bleaching, pollution, and destructive human activity.

Accurately classifying these features using satellite imagery and machine learning allows us to monitor reef health at scale, detect early signs of degradation, and support conservation planning. This is essential for protecting ecosystems that are both ecologically rich and critically endangered.

Traditional benthic surveys cannot keep pace across thousands of dispersed reefs, and global mapping products like the Allen Coral Atlas, although invaluable, are computationally heavy and rely on extensive training data that may not exist for every site. Because our pipeline needs just two co-registered tiles, the method can be ported along a reef tract in hours, supporting near-real-time monitoring after storms or heatwaves.

### Key Concepts

### Methodology
[Describe your overall approach or algorithm.  
Bullet points or sub-headings (“Data Pre-processing”, “Model”, “Evaluation”) often read well here.]
